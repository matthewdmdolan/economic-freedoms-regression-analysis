# Economic Freedoms Regression Analysis

The 2018 Index of Economic Freedom serves as the data source for our analysis, giving us insights into the progress of economic freedom, prosperity, and opportunity over two decades. This Index evaluates 12 freedoms across 186 countries and categorises them into five broad areas.

Size of Government: This category takes into account government spending, taxation, and the magnitude of government-controlled enterprises. The principle here is simple - as government control increases, individual decision-making decreases, reducing economic freedom.

Legal System and Property Rights: Central to both economic freedom and civil society, this area focuses on the protection of individuals and their rightful properties. In essence, it reflects the fundamental function of government - to uphold the rule of law.

Sound Money: The stability of currency is critical in safeguarding the value of rightfully earned wages and savings. With high and volatile inflation, individuals' capacity to plan for the future is disrupted, impinging on their ability to exercise economic freedom effectively.

Freedom to Trade Internationally: This category encapsulates the freedom to exchange goods and services, including transactions with businesses and individuals from other nations. It highlights that economic freedom isn't restricted by borders and underscores the importance of free trade.

Regulation: This area considers the regulatory environment's impact on economic freedom. Regulations can potentially limit rights to international trade, credit access, employment choices, and the freedom to operate businesses.

By applying linear regression analysis to these categories, we've determined the sub-categories that are most analytically valuable:

Freedom to own foreign currency
Judicial Independence
Credit Market Regulations
Inflation
Government Enterprises
Control Movement of Capital and People
Tariffs
Labor Market Regulations
Marginalised Tax Rate
Government Consumption
Black Market
These identified areas can serve as focal points for policymakers seeking to improve economic freedom and create further opportunities within their countries. Our findings illuminate how these sub-categories interplay with the broader areas of economic freedom, laying the groundwork for targeted improvements.
